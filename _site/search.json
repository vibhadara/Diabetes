However, for individuals with glucose levels exceeding 100, diabetic patients show lower insulin levels in comparison to non-diabetic patients, indicating a potential impairment in glucose regulation among individuals with diabetes."

Below is an image of how diabetes among Americans is growing immensely as the years go on. I’ll first see if diabetes is more prevalent in a particular age or gender and then analyze potential factors that contribute to this disease."
