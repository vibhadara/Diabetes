babynames|>
  filter(str_detect(name, "i$")) |>
    summarize(sum_n = sum(n), 
            sum_prop = sum(prop), 
            .by = c(year, sex)) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = sum_prop, fill = sex)) + 
    geom_area() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) + 
    labs(title = "US Names Ending With -i", 
         subtitle = " Males names ending with -i rapidly spiked in 2000s \n The female names ending with -i had a peak around the 1960s", 
         x = "Year",
